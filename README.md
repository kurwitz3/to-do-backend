*Back end code 
*[Front end here](https://github.com/kurwitz3/To-do/tree/main/Frontend)

## Description

This is a cool little app that I use to keep track of things I need to accomplish. I used a Rails api backend so I can add and delete items after I have completed a task.

## Installation 

Run bundle install to install all the gems.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage 

To start the the server run 

```bash 
rails s
```
Then go to the browser and enter the url localhost:3000. You will also need to open the index.html in the frontend.
Instructions are located in the frontend README.md.
